You may use Confidential Information only as needed to access or use the Services pursuant to the Terms. You will protect such Confidential Information with reasonable care in a manner at least as protective as you use for your own Confidential Information. If you are required by law or court order to disclose such Confidential Information, you will give reasonable prior written notice to VidAU and undertake reasonable efforts to limit the sharing of Confidential Information, including assisting VidAU with challenging such a request if possible.\
‍Information should be treated as “Confidential Information” if it is designated as such by VidAU or the third party owner or if it should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances. When in doubt, information should be treated as Confidential Information.

\
**7. Payment**

If you wish to purchase any Services made available by VidAU (“Payment”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Payment including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your billing address. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Payments; and (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete.\
‍We may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating Payment. By submitting your Payment information, you understand that we may share that information with these third parties subject to our [<u>Privacy Policy</u>](https://www.vidau.ai/company/privacy).\
‍We and third-party services facilitating payments on our behalf, reserve the right to reject your Payment due to product or service unavailability, or if fraud or an unauthorised or illegal transaction is suspected. We also reserve the right to refuse payment, cancel an order, or correct pricing errors or mistakes even if we have already issued an invoice or received Payment.\
All prices shown by VidAU are as a standard denominated in USD. We may change our prices from time to time, and these price increases will be effective on the day they are posted on our website. We may determine to show the prices in the currency that VidAU determines to be your local currency. You are responsible for paying any applicable taxes for purchases of any Services, which may be determined based on the billing information provided at the time of service.\
If you have purchased a subscription-based Service, we will charge your Payment on an agreed-upon periodic basis, and we may reasonably change the date on which the charge is posted. You may cancel the subscription payment from your VidAU account. You may also request a refund of a subscription payment within fifteen (15) days of the date of payment, which we may prorate based on the number of credits issued for your subscription payment that you have already used. To request a refund (or partial refund), please contact us by using the on-site messenger or email us at [contact@vidau.ai](mailto:contact@vidau.ai). We will endeavor to issue any refund as soon as possible to the payment method used for the original Payment. We may immediately terminate your use of the Services without notice if you fail to make a Payment.\
‍We may in our sole discretion provide complimentary credits to you that enable free use of Services. You agree that you have no title or interest in these complementary credits, which are not legal tender, and which VidAU may revoke at any time. If you create more than one account or otherwise attempt to fraudulently obtain complementary credits we reserve the right to charge you the purchase price for Services you obtain using the credits or revoke your access to the Services.

\
**8. Refunds**

Payments are nonrefundable except as provided in the Terms. If you make any Payment to VidAU, you have the right to request a refund of the Payment without providing a reason at any time within seven (7) days of the original date of Payment. We reserve the right to only issue a pro-rated refund which reflects the amount of credits you have used that you received from your Payment before claiming a refund. To request a refund (or partial refund), please contact us by using the in-app messenger or email us at [contact@vidau.ai](mailto:contact@vidau.ai). We will issue any refund to the payment method used for the Payment once it’s approved. Refunds do not apply to Enterprise agreements.

\
**17. Waiver**

Failure of either Party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this or any Agreement or the failure of either Party to exercise any right or remedy to which the Party is entitled hereunder shall not constitute a waiver thereof and shall not cause a diminution of the obligations under these Terms or any agreement relating to the Services. No waiver of any of the provisions of these Terms or any agreement relating to the Services shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be such in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of the Company.

\
**18. Dispute Resolution**

YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS.\
‍You and VidAU agree that you will resolve any past or present claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, other than claims brought in small claims court or claims solely for injunctive relief or intellectual property disputes.\
‍You have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by notifying us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Services. Your written notification must include your name and address, as well as a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with VidAU through arbitration. If you do not opt out within thirty (30) days of the date you first access the Services, then you accept all terms and conditions of the arbitration and dispute resolution procedures described in the Terms.\
‍Before initiating a formal action against VidAU, including but not limited to a suit or arbitration, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending VidAU notification by certified mail containing your name, a description of the dispute, the relief you seek, and the best method to contact you regarding your dispute. If we are unable to resolve this dispute in the greater of 60 days or such time as we may mutually agree to resolve the dispute, you may bring a formal proceeding. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during such informal efforts.\
‍In the event the arbitrator determines the claim you asserted in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, or otherwise finds in VidAU’s favor, you agree to reimburse VidAU for all fees associated with the arbitration, including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses.\
‍The arbitrator shall not be permitted to grant injunctive relief (unless the parties mutually agree otherwise) and in any dispute involving monetary and injunctive claims, the monetary claims must be finally resolved in arbitration before seeking injunctive relief in court to the extent permitted by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\
‍Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the arbitration proceeding and all records pertaining to it—including but not limited to any documents prepared or produced in connection with the arbitration proceeding, as well as the hearing and the arbitration award—will be confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.\
‍These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Hongkong, without regard to choice of law rules or principles. Except where a claim must be brought in arbitration or small claims court under these Terms, or to the extent the requirement to arbitrate is held unenforceable or invalid for any reason, proceedings may be commenced only in Hongkong and you and VidAU each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.\
‍You and VidAU also agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any proceeding to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy will be brought and conducted only in the respective party’s individual capacity and not as part of any class (or purported class), consolidated, multiple-plaintiff, or representative action or proceeding (“class action”). You agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class action. You expressly waive any ability to maintain a class action in any forum. If the dispute is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate claims, conduct a class action, or make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Further, you and VidAU agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class action.\
‍You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to VidAU for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and VidAU shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.\
‍Written notice provided under this section shall be sent by mail to : [contact@vidau.ai](mailto:contact@vidau.ai)

\
**19. Notification of Changes**

VidAU reserves the right to change these conditions from time to time as it sees fit and your continued use of the Services will signify your acceptance of any adjustment to these Terms. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you such as by email or via in-product notification of any material changes to these Terms, which will go into effect 30 days after we provide such notice. All other changes take effect immediately and may be without notice. You are solely responsible for re-reading the Terms on a regular basis for any changes.

\
**20. Export Controls**

You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services and/or other information or materials provided by the Company hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable export laws and regulations.

\
**21. Feedback**

We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). You acknowledge and expressly agree that any contribution of Feedback, whether directly to us or by means of a third-party service, does not and will not give or grant you any right, title or interest in the Services or in any such Feedback. All Feedback becomes the sole and exclusive property of VidAU, and VidAU may use and disclose Feedback in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever without further notice or compensation to you and without retention by you of any proprietary or other right or claim. You hereby assign to VidAU any and all right, title and interest (including, but not limited to, any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, show-how, know-how, moral rights and any and all other intellectual property right) that you may have in and to any and all Feedback. To the extent such rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, you hereby waive any moral and author’s rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in and to any and all Feedback.

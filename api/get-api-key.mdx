## How to Get Your API Key

To use the Vidu API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. **Sign Up**: Visit the Vidu platform website and create an account.
2. **Log In**: Once registered, log in to your account.
3. **Access API Keys Section**: Navigate to the API Keys section in your account dashboard.
4. **Generate API Key**: Click on the "Generate API Key" button.
5. **Save Your Key**: Copy and securely store your API key. For security reasons, you won't be able to view it again after leaving the page.

### Using Your API Key

To authenticate your API requests, include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key you generated.

### Security Best Practices

- Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
- Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to store your API keys in applications.
